keras implement of the paper Self-Supervised Neural Aggregation Networks for Human Parsing

This code implement three kinds model for LIP dataset(Look into Person: Self-supervised Structure-sensitive Learning and A New
Benchmark for Human Parsing)

Data preparing:please download the LIP(single person train,val dataset, a baidu drive link is )

To evaluate
